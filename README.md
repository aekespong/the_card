# This is the Card

the Card helps teams to organize and share information in a structured yet flexible way.

* Cards can include attachments like diagrams and images

## Support AI/LLM 

* The AI/LLM dialogues can be saved and reused by team members
* Use AI/LLM to fill a new Card with content in a very fast and easy way.

## Organization Tools

* Cards can be assigned different statuses and types for categorization
* Cards can be tagged with responsible persons and business units
* Search and filtering capabilities
* Advanced settings for customizing status labels and card types

## Collaboration Features

## UI/UX
